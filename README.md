An essential educational tool.
When students are tired of seeing numbers from a long day of school, colours are a nice way to send the message to the 
brain whether it is time to take a break or study hard.

Nobody wants to look at a cluttered app, it will more so scare users away. The key is simplicity with neatness and 
organization in mind. The great thing about this app is you only need to setup your entire semester once for every course. It 
takes under 5 minutes to look at your course syllabus, and throw in the numbers. Throughout the course, simply add in your 
marks, and let the app guide you from there.

Checky shows everything that is due next in every course in one quick look. Colour indicators can quickly show what courses 
need improvement. The aim is to trick the mind (especially those with OCD lol) into aiming for better marks, to achieve an 
overall green status. It may be one thing to choose to ignore an assignment or pracrastinate studying for a test, but when it 
is the only course standing out as red, it is hard to ignore.

This app was designed for realistic use by students of various habits.
It is very easy to use and realistic as it requires little setup time, 
which is perfect for students who are not even serious about their 
courses to give it a try. With students who lack motivation, giving 
this app one try and seeing the benefits of it can lighten the 
workload itself, and produce better grades.
